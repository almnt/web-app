Coined by queer, Black feminist scholar Moya Bailey in 2008, misogynoir is a blend of the words “misogyny” (prejudice and discrimination towards women) and “noir” (a French word meaning Black). Misogynoir describes the impact of misogyny and anti-Black racism on Black women. Though coined by Moya Bailey, Trudy (aka @thetrudz) of Gradient Lair also impacted the spread and usage of the term.

## Issues

Feminist conversations around misogyny tend to center on white (and white-adjacent) women, with Black women often forgotten. In the early days of usage, people mistakenly used misogynoir to describe misogyny towards all women of color. Refrain from doing this, as misogynoir redirects attention and focuses on _Black_ women’s unique experiences due to gender discrimination _and_ anti-Black racism.

## Impact

Misogynoir is most often enacted in media, pop culture, and through state violence.
